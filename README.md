## Introduction

Asynchronous programming allows you to write concurrent code that can handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking. Python's asyncio library provides tools for writing asynchronous code using coroutines, event loops, and tasks.

This repository demonstrates how to use asyncio and websockets to create a simple chat application where multiple clients can communicate with each other in real-time.
